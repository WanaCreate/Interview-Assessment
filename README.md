# üöÄ Hybrid Integration Challenge: Native Kotlin to Flutter

## Project Goal
The primary objective of this challenge is to assess your ability to implement a robust **hybrid mobile application** architecture. You will be tasked with integrating and managing a persistent **Flutter Engine** within a **Native Android (Kotlin)** application, demonstrating lifecycle management and seamless native-to-Flutter navigation using specific routes.

---

## Prerequisites
To successfully complete this project, please ensure you have the following tools and knowledge:

1.  **Development Environment:** **Android Studio** (Dolphin or later) installed.
2.  **SDKs:** **Flutter SDK** (v3.19 or later) installed and configured for your environment.
3.  **Language Proficiency:** Strong knowledge of **Kotlin** (minimum v1.8).
4.  **Framework Familiarity:** Experience working with the Flutter **`FlutterEngine`** and **`FlutterActivity`** classes.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Task Description (Deliverables)

You will be creating or modifying an Android shell project and an associated basic Flutter module.

### **Phase 1: Engine Caching and Initialization**

1.  **Initialize the Flutter Engine:** As soon as the native application starts, modify the Android application logic (e.g., in a custom `Application` class) to eagerly **initialize and cache** a single instance of the `FlutterEngine`.
2.  **Engine Name:** The cached engine instance **MUST** be named `my_cached_engine`.

### **Phase 2: UI and Route Setup**

1.  **Native UI:** Create a single native Kotlin `Activity` (the main landing page) that hosts **two distinct `Button` elements**.
2.  **Flutter Module:** Create a simple Flutter module containing two separate screens/widgets:
    * **`HomePage`:** Maps to the default route (`/`).
    * **`DetailPage`:** Maps to the named route (`/detail`).

### **Phase 3: Native-to-Flutter Navigation**

The two buttons on the native Kotlin activity must launch the Flutter environment using the **cached engine** (`my_cached_engine`), navigating directly to the specified Flutter route.

| Button Label | Action Required | Flutter Route Target | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Open Home** | Launch Flutter Activity | **`/` (HomePage)** | Test default route launch. |
| **Open Detail** | Launch Flutter Activity | **`/detail` (DetailPage)** | Test named route launch. |

**Key Requirement:** The solution **must reuse** the pre-initialized and cached `my_cached_engine` for both navigation actions to avoid engine recreation.

## Êèê‰∫§ Submission Guidelines

1.  **Repository Setup:** Fork this challenge repository or create a new one to host your solution.
2.  **Commit Quality:** Maintain a clean, logical, and descriptive commit history detailing the steps taken.
3.  **Final State:** Ensure the final, runnable code is pushed to the main branch (`main` or `master`).
4.  **Instructions:** Include clear instructions in the `README.md` on how to **run and test the application** from a clean checkout (e.g., "how to link the Flutter module," "build steps").

## üìä Evaluation Criteria

Your solution will be thoroughly assessed based on the following weighted criteria:

| Criteria | Weight | Focus Area |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Engine Caching** | **40%** | Correct initialization of the `my_cached_engine` on startup and its subsequent reuse by both native buttons. |
| **Correct Routing** | **30%** | Successful launch of the Flutter environment to the default route (`/`) and the specific named route (`/detail`) via the native buttons. |
| **Code Quality** | **20%** | Readability, adherence to Kotlin and Dart best practices, clear separation of platform-specific and framework logic, and modern API usage. |
| **Documentation** | **10%** | Clarity of inline comments for complex logic and thoroughness of submission/running instructions. |

Good luck! We look forward to seeing how you handle this modern mobile development scenario.
